Description: Azure Data Fundamentals DP-900 voucher to get 80% discount.

Hey folks, if you want to achieve some certification this year, keep an eye open for vouchers. A few months ago, Oracle released a set of free courses with certifications. Now it's Microsoft time. Microsoft is updating they're certifications and we have a voucher of 80% discount using the coupon **DP900Norfolk** at the checkout of the beta certification DP-900. 

Be aware that this certification is in beta and the result won't be instantly available as the regular ones.
