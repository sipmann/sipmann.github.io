A few weeks ago I started posting at `Grepora <https://grepora.com/blog/>`_ blog. If you like or are looking for some Oracle related stuff, Grepora it's a good place to go and spend a time reading :). From time to time I'll be posting there, it doesn't mean that this blog will be closed or anything like that, but probably this one will be more focused on Front-end stuff, a few tricks with linux and a lil less with Java.
