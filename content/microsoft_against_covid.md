Has your job been affected by covid? Well, last week I've posted on [Grepora](https://grepora.com/2020/09/17/microsoft-ignite-certification-voucher/) about a Free Certification Voucher that Microsoft was giving away at the Microsoft Ignite event. After that, I found that they were also giving a huge discount to people who have had their job affected by covid pandemic.
